# ðŸ”¥ This isn't actually lazy in this library..

.. because we can't keep track of the model without existential types. It just
eagerly evaluates. This set of function is here to serve as a drop-in
replacement.

{-| A performance optimization that delays the building of virtual DOM nodes.

Calling `(view model)` will definitely build some virtual DOM, perhaps a lot of
it. Calling `(lazy view model)` delays the call until later. During diffing, we
can check to see if `model` is referentially equal to the previous value used,
and if so, we just stop. No need to build up the tree structure and diff it,
we know if the input to `view` is the same, the output must be the same!
